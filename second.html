		<h2><i><a name=nsx></a>NSX Type R</i></h2>
		<div><p>Honda produced a very limited number of NSX Type R models from 1992 to 1995 for Japan. Major changes include a more aggressive suspension and an </br>
		extensive weight reduction to 1230 kg from the normal NSX weight of 1350 kg. </br>
		The NSX Type R was track oriented and, to reduce weight, lacked sound deadening, audio, electric windows and air conditioning. The NSX Type R's role </br>
		was fulfilled by the NSX Type S Zero in 1997.<br/>

		<h2><i><a name=integra></a>Integra Type R</i></h2>
		<div><p>In 1995, Honda introduced their first Integra Type R to the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM).</br>
		The Type R would have numerous differences vs. other Integra models that incrementally added to the overall performance of the vehicle. The engine, </br>
		transmission, body, suspension, brakes and interior were all revised in comparison to other Integra models.</br>
		The Type R was equipped with a 1.8-liter DOHC VTEC in-line 4-cylinder (B18C) engine. The JDM Type R engine produced 200 PS @ 8,000 rpm . The US Type R </br>
		would produce 195 HP at 8,000 rpm and 130 lbs./ft. of torque at 5,700 rpm. JDM and other international markets came with 11:1 compression ratio while the </br>
		US Integra Type R had 10.6:1 compression. There were numerous differences between the Type R engine and the DOHC VTEC engine available in other Integra </br>
		models (GS-R) but the increased power was primarily due to the higher compression, larger throttle body, high lift camshafts and high-volume exhaust manifold.</br>
		The Type R came only with a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission. First gear and the final drive were identical to the GS-R transmission but gears 2-5 were </br>
		spaced much closer. In addition, the Type R came equipped with a Helical limited-slip differential. In 1998, the JDM Type R and other international markets </br>
		would receive a revised final drive ratio of 4.785 while the US Type R only had a 4.40 final drive ratio.</br>
		The focus of the Type R was to minimize weight while enhancing rigidity. The Type R has larger strut tower bars, rear performance rods on the rear frame and </br>
		numerous body reinforcements. The Type R had revised springs and dampers as well as larger sway bars.</br>
		The Type R has 5 lug (standard Integra’s have 4 lugs) 15 x 6 aluminum wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza RE010 195/55R15 tires. Larger rotors and calipers</br>
		were included and the ABS system was revised as well. The 1998 JDM Type R would receive 16” alloy wheels wrapped in 215/45/ZR16 tires.</p></div>

		<h2><i><a name=civic></a>Civic Type R</i></h2>
		<div><p>The 1997 EK9 Civic was third to be given the Type R badge. Based on the EK4 SiR chassis it featured a Type R prepared B16B engine producing 185 PS (182 hp),</br>
		stiffer chassis, upgraded sway bars and strut bars, Recaro alcantara seats, 15-inch alloy wheels and a large boot spoiler. Since then, most generations have </br>
		offered a Type R variant. The first generation Type R version of the Civic was the only version not offered outside Japan.July 2015 saw the launch of the brand </br>
		new Honda Civic Type-R to the UK market, manufactured at their Swindon plant. The vehicle offers blistering performance in the form of an all-new, direct-injected </br>
		turbocharged 2.0 litre VTEC TURBO petrol engine boasting more than 276 bhp. The turbo-charged k20c1 engine being built in the United States at the Anna Engine</br> 
		Plant in Anna, Ohio. This high-performance car can go from 0 - 60 mph in a staggering 5.7 seconds and has a top speed of 167 mph.<br/></div>
